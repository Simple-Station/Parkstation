The files here will will, in order, build the game, copy the correct config file, launch the server, and launch the client.
There are some variations of files, explained here

The debug vs release build is simply what people dev in vs the actual server. The release build contains various 
optimizations, while the debug build contains debugging tools. 
If you're mapping, use the release build as it will run smoother.

The Server config file simply matches the actual server config, while the other two have some cvar tweaks that come in 
handy for their specific tasks. 
Essentially only saves you some commands when you load in, but very convenient none the less.
