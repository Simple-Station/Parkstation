# TODO
<!--
If this PR is a work in progress, you can keep track of what you need to do here.
A checklist can be made using the following syntax:
- [ ] Task

- [ ] Other Task
-->

# Media
<!--
If applicable, add screenshots or videos to showcase your PR.
This makes it much easier for us to merge PRs.
Refactors or small fixes are exempt, but all PRs which make ingame changes (adding clothing, items, new features, etc) must include ingame media or the PR will not be merged.
Use screenshot software like Window's built in snipping tool, ShareX, Lightshot, or recording software like ShareX (gif), ScreenToGif, or Open Broadcaster Software (cross platform).
If you're unsure whether your PR will require media, ask a maintainer.

# Changelog
<!--
Here you can fill out a changelog that will automatically be added to the game when your PR is merged.
There are 4 icons for changelog entries: add, remove, tweak, fix.

You can put your name after the :cl: symbol to change the name that shows in the changelog.
Like so:
:cl: PJB

Generally, only put things in changelogs that players actually care about.
Stuff like "Refactored X system, no changes should be visible" shouldn't be on a changelog.

For writing actual entries, don't consider the entry type suffix (e.g. add) to be "part" of the sentence:
bad: - add: a new tool for engineers
good: - add: added a new tool for engineers
-->

:cl:
- add: Added fun!
- tweak: Tweaked fun!
- fix: Fixed fun!
- remove: Removed fun!
