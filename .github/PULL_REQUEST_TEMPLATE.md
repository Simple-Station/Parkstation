# Media
<!--
If applicable, add screenshots or videos to showcase your PR.
Refactors or small fixes are exempt, but all PRs which make ingame changes (adding clothing, items, new features, etc) must include ingame media or the PR will not be merged.
This makes it much easier for us to merge PRs and find media for progress reports.
If you include media in your pull request, we may potentially use it in the progress reports, with clear credit given.

# Changelog
<!--
Here you can fill out a changelog that will automatically be added to the game when your PR is merged.
There are 4 icons for changelog entries: add, remove, tweak, fix.

You can put your name after the :cl: symbol to change the name that shows in the changelog.
Like so:
:cl: PJB

Generally, only put things in changelogs that players actually care about.
Stuff like "Refactored X system, no changes should be visible" shouldn't be on a changelog.

For writing actual entries, don't consider the entry type suffix (e.g. add) to be "part" of the sentence:
bad: - add: a new tool for engineers
good: - add: added a new tool for engineers
-->

:cl:
- add: Added fun!
- tweak: Tweaked fun!
- fix: Fixed fun!
- remove: Removed fun!
