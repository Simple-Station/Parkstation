objective-condition-pickpocket-description = You've got sticky fingers, and get a thrill from taking things, regardless of whether or not you should have them. Be smart about it, a rifle from the armory probably isn't worth it, but a pen from the HoP's desk? Score.

objective-condition-obsessed-title = Obsessed.
objective-condition-obsessed-description = Their hair. Their smell. The look in their eyes. You just cannot get enough of this person. You don't want them to be afraid of you, but if there's a opportunity where you can spend more time with them, or see what they're doing, you're going to take it.

objective-condition-dealer-title = Dealer.
objective-condition-dealer-description = You know that the best way to make bank is getting people hooked on what you're selling- be it chemical, luxury, or pretty much anything else controlled.
