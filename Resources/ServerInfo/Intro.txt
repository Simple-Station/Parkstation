Welcome to Parkstation!! You have just started your shift aboard a Nanotrasen station. Your goal, of course, is to create an interesting and rewarding story for yourself, and those you interact with!

Please make sure you understand the server rules (F1) and if you have any questions, consult this guide, your colleagues on shift in person or over radio or via discord. You can also ask admins for help (ahelp) by hitting the escape key > admin help and typing a message to any online admins. Especially do this if you witness someone breaking rules.

To reiterate, you are all a crew of people who work together (even the clown) and you should not be harming each other unless you have an extremely good reason (self defence) and even then, call security over radio, stun and detain, do not commit murder as a non antagonist (see antagonist further down).
